  After each guess you need to enter input how many colors the computer guesses are in the correct position relative to  
  your colors order and how many colors the computer guesses are in your colors but not in the correct position
  
  # Example

 We will enter 0 position correctly 
 And 3 not in the right place (red blue orange)
